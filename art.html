        <h2 class="font1">Origin of Warli painting</h2>
        <p class="font1"> The Warli tribe of India is believed to be the creators of the Warli painting style. This type
            of painting is thought to date back to 10,000 BC. The paintings were initially created for ceremonial and
            religious purposes. The Warli tribe is still in existence today and their paintings can be seen in various
            museums and galleries around the world. </br>
        <h2 class="font1"> The Mural Art of Warli Painting</h2>
        <p class="font1">The Warli people from India are renowned for their beautiful, large-scale mural paintings.
            These paintings depict scenes from daily life and Hindu mythology and are often incredibly intricate and
            detailed. Warli paintings are usually done on the walls of homes and temples and are an important part of
            Warli culture.

            featuring articles on the history and meaning of Warli art and interviews with contemporary Warli artists.
         
        </p>

        </p>
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            There are two main types of Warli paintings — traditional and contemporary. Traditional Warli paintings are
            created using a limited palette of natural colors, while contemporary Warli paintings often incorporate a
            wider range of colors. Traditional Warli paintings also tend to be more symmetrical in design, while
            contemporary Warli paintings often have more asymmetrical or abstract designs
        </p>
        <p class="font1">The Warli paintings are done on the walls of the huts. The Warli artists use a bamboo stick,
            with which they make dots and lines. They use a white paste, made of rice flour, to make the paintings. The
            Warlis paint the walls of their huts on special occasions, like weddings and festivals. </br>

            The basic principle of the Warli painting is that all the elements of a painting are made up of dots and
            lines. The various motifs used in these paintings are inspired by the everyday life of the Warlis. The
            motifs include animals, birds, trees, and human figures.</br>

            The Warli paintings are not only aesthetically pleasing but also have deep symbolism. For instance, the tree
            is seen as a symbol of fertility, while the snake is seen as a symbol of protection. Similarly, the sun and
            moon represent the cycle of life. </p>
        <p class="font1">The Warli painting tradition is thought to date back to approximately 10,000 BCE. The paintings
            were originally done on the walls of huts, using a mixture of cow dung and soil as the primary medium. The
            paintings depicted scenes from everyday life, such as hunting and farming. Over time, the Warli paintings
            began to be done on paper and cloth, and the subjects expanded to include religious and ceremonial scenes.

            Today, Warli painting is enjoying a resurgence in popularity, both in India and abroad. The simple yet
            powerful images continue to resonate with people of all ages. If you’re interested in learning more about
