     <p class="font1">The gaming industry in India was introduced in the early ’90s. Hand-held gaming consoles became
            a vogue. A couple of years later, smartphones were introduced. The number of people accessing smartphones
            with data gradually was increasing. Online gaming is now available at one easy click. The recent obsession
            of Facebook games like Candy Crush, Clash of Clans and the most popular one PUBG has caught the attention of
            the young Indian crowd – spending hours at length on the interface. Games based on well-known events like
            Kaun Banega Crorepati, IPL, Khel Kabbadi, and T20fever.com, etc. are becoming a trending initiator of
            entertainment amongst the teenagers & millennials..</p>
        <p class="font1">
            As of the year 2019, India is ranked as one of the top five mobile gaming markets in the world in numbers.
            The Indian online gaming industry is assumed to generate earnings of INR 11,900 crores and the number of
            users projected to become 628 million by then by the end of 2023. With a business of $890 million in 2018,
            the video game sector is still underdeveloped in contrast to other Asian countries, such as China and South
            Korea. However, many video game companies are rising to invest, and India could become a prime market for
            this sector. One of the factors that drove the growth of the video game market was its large number of
            cybercafés with more than 100,000 in 2006, 40% of which were used to play online.
