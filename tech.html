            In Albert Camus’ 1942 essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, the Greek god Sisyphus is condemned by the other gods to
            endlessly roll a boulder uphill, only for it to roll back down each time he nears the summit. Camus sees
            Sisyphus’ plight as a metaphor for the human condition, highlighting the absurdity of existence. In today’s
            times, we may also find ourselves doing mundane jobs day in and day out and get struck by the profound
            absurdity of life. We may begin to question the meaning behind our efforts, wondering if they hold any
            significance in the grand scheme of things.</br>
            
              
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            With AI advancing rapidly, the sense of insignificance we feel might intensify. AI possesses remarkable
            abilities, such as creating art and offering medical guidance. While it enhances comfort, it could also
            deprive us of real-life challenges essential for finding meaning. This could lead to increased feelings of
            disorientation and more frequent confrontations with life’s absurdities. Hence, it becomes increasingly
            crucial to explore our role in the universe. What sets us apart from AI? What defines our essence and
            purpose? These questions gain even greater relevance as we navigate the evolving relationship between
            humanity and technology.
            </br>
            Absurdism explores the tension between humanity’s search for meaning and the apparent indifference of the
            universe. Humans have toyed with the ideas of absurdism since ancient times. Philosophy can act as night
            vision goggles in the midst of the dark forest of absurdism. It can help us frame the right questions and
            find our own unique answers, illuminating the path through the forest. Numerous philosophers, both Eastern
            and Western, have navigated this terrain, offering invaluable wisdom.

                <div class="home-article-img">
                    <img src="ai.jpg" alt="article">
                </div>
               
            </div>
        </p>
        <p class="font1">For instance, philosophy can help us understand what is our truest essence and how that makes
            us different from AI machines. Take for instance the ancient Vedanta philosophy. It defines self or our
            inner essence as Brahman or pure consciousness. Since it is non-material, an AI machine, no matter how
            smart, would be fundamentally different from us. Brahman transcends all dualities and distinctions,
            including those of time and space. In the light of AI developing human like capabilities we will be
            compelled to dig deeper to understand our inner essence or Brahman. </p>
        <p class="font1">As the younger generation witnesses AI’s capabilities in various fields, they may grapple with
            feelings of insignificance and existential angst. The lure of convenience and efficiency may overshadow the
            pursuit of deeper meaning and personal growth. Without meaningful engagement and purposeful challenges, they
            could find themselves adrift in a sea of technological advancement. They may conclude that life lacks
            inherent meaning and our actions are inconsequential. However, this perception could entrap them in a
            misleading mindset. </br>
            Being drawn to absurdism is a risky predicament. It surrenders one’s agency to make a difference. However,
            it also gives an opportunity to look at life with a new pair of spectacles and not take anything for
            granted. Ancient wisdom and philosophical methods can assist in navigating through complexities, discovering
            our purpose, and transitioning from contemplation to action. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna advises Arjuna
            against succumbing to intellectual paralysis, emphasizing the importance of action.
