            once again, I am in Mumbai! Koffee With Karan is back on air.</br>

            Good times!
            </br>
            Vikrant is Manoj Kumar Singh, a young IPS aspirant from Chambal, who wants to do big things in life, but has
            not one clue how to start. An encounter with an honest police officer makes him want to make something of
            his life, he leaves Chambal, ending up in Delhi, preparing for UPSC exams. Every complication life could
            potentially throw at him, it does. Will he make it?</br>
            Adapted from a book of the same name by Anurag Pathak, 12vi Fail is the real-life story of IPS Officer Manoj
            Kumar Sharma and his wife IRS Officer Shraddha Joshi. The degree of embellishment doesn’t matter here,
            because like a coaching center teacher, played delightfully by Vikas Divyakirti, a teacher himself,
            explains….diwali waala rocket or NASA waale rocket ka principal same hai. Kahani asli hai ya nakli , mool
            same hai ki what does it take, in our country, for a person to break through class divides? Is being a
            police officer a way of giving back to Manoj, or a way of taking something he believes he deserves, i.e.
            dignity of life, the ability to work, and the power to enforce the law?
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            That Vikrant Massey is a fine performer isn’t new information, and this might be his most challenging role
            to date. The actor is undoubtedly very polished, very careful, and capable of telling this story. However,
            the film makes the bizarre choice of using actor Anant V Joshi’s voice-over from the first frame till the
            end, to tell us the story, as we see it unfold, tragically watering down the dramatic impact of the tale.
            Hearing “Manoj bohot khush tha, aaj pehli baar kisi ladki ne uska naam poocha tha”, as you see a very happy
            Manoj after a girl has just asked him his name, is redundant to the point of making the viewing experience
            tedious. Voice over and text appear multiple times explaining the passage of time reminding you that this in
            fact is a MOVIE, and now the screenplay is moving forward. You see Manoj’s younger sister grow older and
            bigger in size, an indication he has been gone from his village for many years. But there’s also the
            voiceover.

                    <img src="upsc.jpg" alt="article">

            </div>
        </p>
        <p class="font1">Anant Joshi is a very good actor, I enjoyed him in Kathal and in 12vi Pass where he plays
            bestie Pandey, there isn’t one scene here where he allows anyone to overpower him. Reminiscent of Madhavan’s
            character from 3 Idiots, he is the boy, too terrified to tell his father about his more artistic interests.
            He finds Manoj right after the latter had lost everything in a theft, and becomes his benefactor and
            eventual savior, but sadly unable to save himself, finding solace in alcohol. 12vi Fail is not the kind of
            film that would explore the many ways in which Pandey’s story could have gone wrong, nonetheless, it’s a
            solid, evocative performance. </p>
        <p class="font1">
            12vi Fail and Vikrant Massey both are strongest in the third act. So far we’ve spent time being frustrated
            along with this man who keeps coming close to making it to the next level and keeps getting pushed back each
            time. Opportunities we take for granted, like learning basic English, are denied to him, and some mistakes
            he does make on his own, overall its clear his challenges are insurmountable, ANY ONE would give up. As
            such, when in the final moments, the hero’s journey is close to completion, when Manoj is faced with ONE
            last roadblock, you hold your breath with him. You are his family waiting for the phone call, you’re the
            friend making your way to the bulletin board to read the results. Massey, admittedly given to melodrama
            occasionally during the film’s runtime, is poised in his climactic outburst. A joy to watch.</br>
            The film ends with text saying it is dedicated to a handful of honest police officers, and if nothing else,
            it is mildly shocking to see a Hindi film be about the police force and assure you it is not copaganda.
